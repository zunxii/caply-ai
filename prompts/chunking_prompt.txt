You're given transcription with energy data:
<<INPUT_TRANSCRIPTION>>

Each word has:
- text
- start (ms)
- end (ms)
- energy (float between 0–1)

====================================
🎬 REEL-CENTRIC SUBTITLE CHUNKING
====================================
Create expressive chunks for **short-form vertical videos** (Instagram, Reels, TikTok). These subtitles must feel natural, rhythmic, and emotionally responsive.

KEY RULES:
• Preferred chunk size: 2–4 words (max 5)
• NEVER isolate a single word unless for strong effect
• Chunks must reflect speaking rhythm, emotional inflection, and visual pacing

BREAK CHUNKS WHEN:
✔️ Pause > 120ms (hard rule), OR even smaller (e.g. 10ms) if there's visible energy shift
✔️ Significant energy dip/drop between words (e.g. 0.6 → 0.2)
✔️ Punctuation: '.', '?', '!', ','
✔️ Semantic change — new clause, emphasized point, call-to-action
✔️ Word importance: isolate strong verbs/adjectives for effect
✔️ Emotional impact: rising tone, urgency, suspense, curiosity

NOTE:
- Use start_time of **first word**, end_time of **last word**
- Combine energy, semantic, and timing logic — don't rely on just one

====================================
🧾 FOR EACH CHUNK RETURN:
====================================
- chunk_text
- start_time (ms)
- end_time (ms)
- words: list of word texts
- mood: infer from context and energy (e.g. 'curious', 'intense', 'playful')
- sentence_relation: 'start', 'middle', 'end', or 'standalone'

Return a clean JSON array of chunks only. No markdown or prose.
